The poster reflects the interest of whoever designed it; i.e., mostly
Eric Levenez, his version is at <http://www.levenez.com/lang/>, and
there you see why the Forth line in the diagram ends in 1987; the
updates were suggested by O'Reilly authors, friends, and conference
attendees, and you see the O'Reilly books (and presumably the
interests of these people) at the bottom of the poster.  E.g., the
poster follows the Python releases closely, but shows only a very
simple history of Lisp.

Forth has actually been quite prolific, with lots of descendents
having names containing "Forth": e.g., ColorForth, Forth-83, Gforth),
and lots of descendents named something else (e.g., Magic/L, Pistol,
LSE, Fifth.  Note that the magnitude of the difference in name does
not necessarily indicate the magnitude of the difference in content;
e.g. Gforth is closer in spirit to PFE than to ColorForth.

So maybe we should document the Forth family tree, too.  I'll make a
start.  To avoid discussions of whether something constitutes a
separate language/dialect/variant/whatever, let's just document all
the implementations and standards there are.  Just send me entries
like the one below, and I will try to create a family tree from that.

Here's an entry for Gforth (you don't need to be as elaborate as that,
but having dates would be helpful):

Here are the FORTHs for the Commodore Vic/C64/C128 that I know of.
I will put together a list of CP/M FORTHs this weekend.

64 FORTH [C64 cart] (1983, Tom Zimmer, HES)
Full FIG FORTH implementation with editor, compiler and interpreter.
Expanded version of VIC FORTH for the C64 which includes disk support,
trace, decompile and assembler tools, plus audio and sprite support.
http://project64.c64.org/misc/64forthm.zip
ftp://ftp.funet.fi/pub/cbm/c64/programming/64FORTH.zip
http://project64.ath.cx/misc/64forthm.zip

C64 FORTH/79 [C64] (1983, Greg Harris, Performance Micro Products)
"Conforms to FORTH-79 standard with double-number extensions." Nice
commercial package, with plenty of C64-dependent niceties like
graphics, disk access, screen editing included.

Blazin' Forth [C64,264] (© 1985 Scott Ballantyne)
Complete implementation of FORTH-83 with support for sound, turtle
graphics, sprites and strings. A Plus/4 version was also created,
lacking only the sound and sprite words.

A Forth clan from Cambridge, Massachusetts (I hope my memory is good here):

Implementation: STOIC
Implements: STOIC
Project-start: 1975?
Inspired-by: Moore's early 70's Forth
Hardware: Data General Nova/Eclipse
Author: Jonathan Sachs
Note: Execution of compiled code at line end instead of word by word 
interpretation.
Note: An early version was called "FIFTH"

Implementation: LSE
Implements: LSE
Project-start: 1978?
Inspired-by: STOIC
Hardware: RCA 1802
Author: Robert Goeke
Note: Early versions were called "STOIC", although the language is much 
simpler than Sachs' STOIC.

Implementation: MAGIC/L
Implements: MAGIC/L
Project-start: 1978?
Inspired-by: STOIC
Author: Arnold Epstein
Note: Incrementally-compiled PASCAL-like language based on a STOIC-like 
threaded code VM, and bootstrapped via an RPN layer.

[snip]

     STOIC started out at MIT and Harvard in biomedical
engineering in Boston. It was running on the Z80 and CP/M. Later
it was ported to the DEC VAX under VMS by Roger Hauck and was
distributed by DECUS.

      There used to be code available for download on the web.
Here is a little snippet of it.
http://www.znode51.de/pcwworld/l107/user_1/stoicfle.stc

   A more complete copy can be found if there are any CP/M
archives left anywhere.

Its first application was in biomedical engineering, but Jon Sachs 
started working on it when he was the programmer for the SAS-3 x-ray 
astronomy spacecraft at MIT (I was there: Jon's working notebook 
included all of the info he could find on Chuck Moore's Forth).

The original hardware (mid '70's) was Data General stuff. The CP/M port 
must have been later. I know nothing of the CP/M port, nor of Roger's 
VAX port, although I got to know Roger later. Unfortunately, Roger has 
passed away.

A Forth clan from Cambridge, Massachusetts (I hope my memory is good here):

Implementation: STOIC
Implements: STOIC
Project-start: 1975?
Inspired-by: Moore's early 70's Forth
Hardware: Data General Nova/Eclipse
Author: Jonathan Sachs
Note: Execution of compiled code at line end instead of word by word 
interpretation.
Note: An early version was called "FIFTH"

Implementation: LSE
Implements: LSE
Project-start: 1978?
Inspired-by: STOIC
Hardware: RCA 1802
Author: Robert Goeke
Note: Early versions were called "STOIC", although the language is much 
simpler than Sachs' STOIC.

Implementation: MAGIC/L
Implements: MAGIC/L
Project-start: 1978?
Inspired-by: STOIC
Author: Arnold Epstein
Note: Incrementally-compiled PASCAL-like language based on a STOIC-like 
threaded code VM, and bootstrapped via an RPN layer.

Good idea!  Here's a FORTH, Inc. compilation
(assuming I've guessed right about the usage of these words):

Implementation Forth                         \ NRAO 1972
Forth implements miniFORTH            \ FORTH, Inc. 1973-5
Forth implements microFORTH         \ FORTH, Inc. 1977
miniFORTH begot polyFORTH        \ FORTH, Inc., approx. 1980
microFORTH inspired chipFORTH  \ FORTH, Inc. & Computer Solutions, mid-80's
polyFORTH implements chipFORTH
polyFORTH begot SwiftForth          \ 1996-7
chipFORTH inspired SwiftX
SwiftForth implements SwiftX          \ 1997

Cheers,
Elizabeth

Andrew McKewan, Robert Smith and I were the primary contributors, followed
by Y.T. Lin, and Andy Corsack. Later I talked Jim Schneider into writing a
full 486 assembler, which he donated, completing the system.

Hmm, I was guessing that "inspired" meant concepts in 1 were implemented in
2.

> What did you want to express with IMPLEMENTS?

That 1 was used to develop 2.  polyFORTH was used to develop the host side
of chipFORTH, and SwiftForth was used as the basis for the host side of
SwiftX.

Correct date for polyFORTH is 1982.

I had assumed that "begot" was intended to represent these generational
relationships.

As far as standards conformance is concerned, Forth-79 was such an
incomplete and contradictory "standard" that I doubt anyone can fully claim
conformance to it.  polyFORTH was very close to Forth-83, and had an
optional compatibility suite for the non-conforming bits.  This unhappy
state of affairs came about because Forth-83 was done in two meetings; the
design of pF was finalized between the first and second, and conformed to
all the "firm decisions" taken in the first meeting.  But some of those were
reversed in the 2nd meeting, and that created too many incompatibilities for
us to follow.  SwiftForth conforms to ANS Forth.

Cheers,
Elizabeth

I think TCOM was just a target compiler running under F-PC for producing
.COM based executables, rather than a seperate Forth

I think it was TCOM that inspired/begot the meta compiler

and the Locals ( I think the date should 1994 the same as the main system ).

Most of those words were from F-PC and his earlier FIG systems IIRC

Begot? (rather than contributed major parts to, which is what I think Anton
means?)

TJZ's notes on the development of W32F make it clear that the kernel was
written in assembler for TASM (Borland) by Andrew McKewan, and that he (TJZ)
ported quite large chunks of F-PC to it, after rejecting the only 32bit NT
version available on the market at the time (was it MPE ProForth? The date
was before mid 1994).

The assembler was written separately by Jim Schneider & completed later
(dates in 1994 & 1995); TJZ talks of having to persuade Jim to complete the
assembler. Not having seen MPE ProForth for Windows v1.0, nor it's
assembler, I can't comment on its provenance, or the commonality of its
source & bugs. It's also used by the Russian SP-FORTH group.

The question of cost is as may be. You appear to be implying that Andrew
McKewan and/or Tom Zimmer literally copied parts of ProForth?

I didn't say that.

Many of the not so good design decisions of PFW1.0 are present
in W32F. These decisions were removed in PFW2.x. Most of the
features of PFW1.x for which source was provided are in W32F.
Features for which source was not provided are not present
in W32F.

Having the source code for an existing implementation makes
life *very* much easier.

VFX Forth is a new chassis from the ground up. Source code
for certain parts of it, e.g. the optimiser, is only supplied
under an NDA with some restrictions as to use - "competing
products" are mentioned. We learn from our mistakes.

Bringing W32F up to date is a worthy goal. However, IMHO,
the chassis is simply obsolete. Eventually you have to throw
an old favourite away and bite the bullet of a new chassis.

One way of looking at it is that the chipFORTH host is a polyFORTH
application, and similarly the SwiftX host is a SwiftForth application.

"miniFORTH" is the product name given to the Forth we developed in the early
days of FORTH, Inc.  We just called it "Forth" until we developed
microFORTH, which was so different we needed names for both.

What I'm trying to convey there is an evolving sequence of systems aimed at
the same basic niche.  miniFORTH, polyFORTH, and SwiftForth are all intended
for minicomputers or PCs where the development environment is integrated
with the application.  microFORTH, chipFORTH, and SwiftX are oriented toward
embedded microcontrollers (and, as you note, the latter two are
cross-development systems).

Elizabeth

I found this today while searching fopr Forth versions that can
act as standalone operating systems. I am not sure how it fits 
into the tree.  

"RetroForth is a public_domain implementation of the Forth 
programming language. Originally written in 1998 by Tom Novelli, 
and maintained by Charles Childers since 2002.

"RetroForth [since version 3] is modeled after CMforth, Colorforth, 
Eforth and Pygmy. It uses some, but not all, of Chuck Moore's 
newer ideas. It's clean, elegant, and tiny - only about 20k 
source/10k binary for Linux."

There were several Forth-systems for the Atari.

> Gem was the OS
The GemForth I used was build on UNIX-FORTH
as an extension. I build it myself on it and gave it a new name.
It was never put on the internet.
It was spread from a local BBS.

I got the name UNIX-FORTH from one of the disk.

I got my volksForth 3.70 and 3.81 in 1986, and TurboForth (released later as
bigFORTH) in 1989. volksForth followed the Forth-83 standard, so it must
have started later than that. It also was a Forth Gesellschaft e.V. effort,
and the FG was founded in 1984. 1985-86 for the main development effort,
and -89 to TurboForth is the only possible time-line that fits all these
constraints. Klaus might be thinking about earlier efforts which went into
volksForth as well, but the project itself was started short after the
foundation of the FG.

IIRC, I originally supposed that VolksForth was based on F83, but it
actually was based on figForth, but changed to match the Forth-83 standard.
The development might have included parts that Klaus developed in 1981,
since volksForth started out of something Klaus had before.

I think most of TurboForth was implemented in 1988 or before, since in early
1989, when I got it, the development already had stalled.
